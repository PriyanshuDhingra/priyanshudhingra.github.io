excerpt: 'This paper addresses the challenge of data scarcity in speech de-identification by introducing a novel, fully automated data augmentation method leveraging large language models. Our approach overcomes the limitations of human annotation, enabling the creation of extensive training datasets. To enhance de-identification performance, we compare pipeline and end-to-end models. While the pipeline approach sequentially applies speech recognition and named entity recognition, the end-to-end model jointly learns these tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our data augmentation strategy and the superiority of the end-to-end model in improving PII detection accuracy and robustness.'

# citation: 'This paper presents a novel approach to address the scarcity of labeled data in speech de-identification, a critical task for protecting personal privacy. By leveraging a large language model, we propose a fully automated data augmentation strategy that generates synthetic speech text data enriched with diverse personally identifiable information (PII) entities. This augmented dataset is then used to train the speech-de-identification models, significantly '

This paper addresses the challenge of data scarcity in speech de-identification by introducing a novel, fully automated data augmentation method leveraging large language models. Our approach overcomes the limitations of human annotation, enabling the creation of extensive training datasets. To enhance de-identification performance, we compare pipeline and end-to-end models. While the pipeline approach sequentially applies speech recognition and named entity recognition, the end-to-end model jointly learns these tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our data augmentation strategy and the superiority of the end-to-end model in improving PII detection accuracy and robustness.

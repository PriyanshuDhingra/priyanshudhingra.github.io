excerpt: 'This paper presents a novel approach to address the scarcity of labeled data in speech de-identification, a critical task for protecting personal privacy. By leveraging a large language model, we propose a fully automated data augmentation strategy that generates synthetic speech text data enriched with diverse personally identifiable information (PII) entities. This augmented dataset is then used to train the speech-de-identification models, significantly improving its performance on spoken language. To further enhance de-identification accuracy, we explore both pipeline and end-to-end models. While the pipeline approach sequentially applies speech recognition and named entity recognition, the end-to-end model jointly learns these tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our data augmentation strategy and the superiority of the end-to-end model in improving PII detection accuracy and robustness.'

This paper presents a novel approach to address the scarcity of labeled data in speech
de-identification, a critical task for protecting personal privacy. By leveraging a large language
model, we propose a fully automated data augmentation strategy that generates synthetic
speech text data enriched with diverse personally identifiable information (PII) entities. This
augmented dataset is then used to train the speech-de-identification models, significantly
improving its performance on spoken language. To further enhance de-identification accuracy,
we explore both pipeline and end-to-end models. While the pipeline approach sequentially
applies speech recognition and named entity recognition, the end-to-end model jointly learns
these tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our data augmentation
strategy and the superiority of the end-to-end model in improving PII detection accuracy
and robustness.

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Selected Experience  

**Finastra (2025 – Present)**  
I work as an Associate Software Engineer (Data Science & AI), where I am building **LLM-powered systems for financial operations**. My contributions include automating test pipelines, developing SQL/data validation checks, and extending vector store coverage with contextual samples. These efforts have streamlined workflows, improved reliability, and increased LLM response accuracy.

**Carnegie Mellon University (2024 – 2025)**  
As a Research Intern, I worked on **BOE-ViT**: a vision transformer for 3D subtomogram alignment, resulting in a paper at **CVPR 2025**. I contributed to the development and evaluation of the **Polyshift** and **MARE** modules, created synthetic data pipelines, generated 2D-slice visualizations, and debugged large-scale training code. My work contributed to experiments achieving **77% lower rotation error and 62% lower translation error** at low SNR.  

**Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (2024)**  
During my internship at NTU’s Speech Lab, I developed an **automatic speech de-identification system** for Singapore English speech. I designed an LLM-based synthetic data generation pipeline, implemented entity-aware ASR models, and improved privacy-preserving speech processing. This work resulted in **4 first-author publications** across IEEE conferences and journals.
